Hi, I'm En-Jui Kuo (郭恩瑞), an Assistant Professor working at the intersection of quantum computing, machine learning, and theoretical physics. My research focuses on open quantum systems, quantum complexity theory, machine learning, mathematical Physics for materials science and optimization problems.

I earned my Ph.D. from the University of Maryland, where I was affiliated with the Joint Quantum Institute (JQI) and the Joint Center for Quantum Information and Computer Science (QuICS).
